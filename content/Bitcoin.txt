Bitcoin Explained

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single 

administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin 

network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by 

network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger 

called a blockchain.

Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the 

name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation 

was released as open-source software.

Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be 

exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Bitcoin has been praised 

and criticized. Critics noted its use in illegal transactions, the large amount 

of electricity used by miners, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. 

Some investors and economists have characterized it as a speculative bubble at 

various times.

Despite its legal and regulatory status being unclear in many jurisdictions, 

Bitcoin has led to the launch of more than a thousand other virtual currencies 

collectively referred to as Altcoins.
